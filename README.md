# Peek-a-Vue (v0.2.0-alpha)

The source code for the card-flipping Halloween themed game built with [Vue.js 3](https://v3.vuejs.org) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=peekavue-bh&utm_campaign=devex)!

## ⚠️ Important Note

The codebase is a fun exploration of Vue.js 3's Composition API and is not representative of best practices or patterns. It is still a work in progress and additional changes will be coming.
